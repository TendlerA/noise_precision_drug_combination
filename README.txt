This work contains the code used in the paper "Noise-precision tradeoff in predicting combinations of mutations and drugs"

The folder drawFigureCode contains script that reproduce the figures.

This code can be used to reproduce the figures and the analysis. In order for it to work it depends on putting the dataset files attached to the paper in the working directory.

The code in the folder "singling_gateway_2006" is not used in the paper, but it can be use to obtain predictions on the dataset from Nature Cell Biology volume 8, pages 571â€“580 (2006).
